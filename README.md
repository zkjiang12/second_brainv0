Saas: Cursor, Perplexity and everyone else (7/4/2025)
Saas is dead. Itâ€™s only a matter of time. 

Why would anyone pay for a $20/month perplexity or cursor subscription when google AI mode, search tools, and  openAI codex, Claude Code, and Gemini CLI exist. 

This is just the beginning, any consumer facing company that seeks to achieve a large market share is fundamentally limited. They create no significant alpha of their own as unless they train their own LLMs, they are fundamentally dependent on the beta of the AI labs and will necessarily lose if the labs view the market captured by the saas tool as important: the labs can outprice you and already have control over distribution. 

The only defense against this is a data moat. Cluely is insufficient as OpenAI and Google especially, can very easily create this. What is relevant is a data moat that arises out of smart glasses. 

If someone can build a reliable second brain for smart glasses user, off the APIs of the model companies before training one themselves, they have a much greater chance of success by providing a step change improvement in user experience which the AI labs cannot easily match.
